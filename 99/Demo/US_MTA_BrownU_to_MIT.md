DesignersNote=This is a Materials Transfer Agreement, not an NDA. But the two are very similar.  A person gives another access to something, under certain conditions, and the business part is not so developed that it looks like a license agreement.  MTAs are a major, high-volume problem for which there are some highly (but imperfectly) developed systems.  Cf. consents to use of information, notably patient consents.  These are interesting also because of the multiple roles - institution and scientist, on both sides.
