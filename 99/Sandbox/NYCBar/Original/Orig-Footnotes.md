 This form was prepared in January 2015 by the Corporation Law Committee of the New York City Bar
Association as a model for a unilateral confidentiality agreement (i.e., to be used when confidential information
is being disclosed by only one party). The draft attempts to reflect the Committee’s view of terms that may be
acceptable to both a buyer and a seller, with additional commentary provided on often-negotiated provisions.
Of course, careful attention to specific facts and client needs is always advisable.

 This form has been drafted assuming the target company is the disclosing party. If a selling equityholder is also
a disclosing party, conforming changes should be made throughout to also reference the selling equityholder, as
appropriate.

 The disclosing party may want to insert the word “negotiated” to make clear that the information may only be
used in a consensual transaction (particularly if a standstill is not included). See Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.
v. Vulcan Materials Co., 56 A 3d 1072 (Del Ch. 2012) and Goodrich Capital, LLC and Windsor Sheffield & Co.
Inc. v. Vector Capital Corporation (S.D.N.Y. June 26, 2012).

 If the potential Buyer is a competitor of the Company, the parties often will establish a “clean team” or
“attorneys eyes only” protocol for dealing with competitively sensitive information and will enter into a
“Common Interest Agreement.” Parties are encouraged to coordinate the provisions of any Common Interest
Agreement with the provisions of their confidentiality agreement. Discontinuity between the terms of the two
agreements created issues for the parties in Martin Marietta Materials. In addition, please see the footnote to
Section 13 regarding an additional covenant to consider in the event that Buyer and the Company are
competitors.

 This bracketed language is only applicable for private equity-type buyers that have other portfolio companies
(or to buyers that are themselves portfolio companies).
6
 Receiving parties may resist including information disclosed prior to the date of the Confidentiality Agreement
depending upon the facts and circumstances.
7
 Disclosing parties may wish to state that “Buyer shall have the burden of proof to demonstrate the absence of
reliance on Evaluation Material.”
8
 Receiving parties may resist including this bracketed language because they may receive information from
sources on a confidential basis (e.g., information may be received from a consultant and there may be an
obligation of confidentiality in the engagement letter with such consultant).
9
 Disclosing parties may resist any knowledge qualifier, and where one is included, receiving parties may resist
an inquiry obligation.
10 Receiving parties may wish to exclude an evidentiary requirement.
11 Disclosing parties may resist any knowledge qualifier, and where one is included, receiving parties may resist
an inquiry obligation.

 12 Parties to consider whether it is appropriate to include debt financing sources in the definition of
Representatives. To the extent debt financing sources are included, it should be considered whether reference
should be generic or whether specific “approved” debt financing sources should be listed on an exhibit.
Similarly, if the Buyer is contemplating having potential co-bidders, consider including a concept of “Permitted
Co-Bidders” and allowing for disclosure of Evaluation Material to Permitted Co-Bidders. Potential definition
of “Permitted Co-Bidder” would be as follows: “Permitted Co-Bidder” means any Person (and any Affiliates of
such Person) who may invest in the Transaction on a side-by-side basis with Buyer, if such Person (or its
Affiliate) [(i)] has executed its own confidentiality agreement with respect to the Transaction with the Company
[and (ii) is listed on Exhibit __]. Note that if the “Permitted Co-Bidder” concept is included, the last proviso in
the definition should be deleted.
13 Disclosing party should consider whether specific exceptions to the use restriction are appropriate. 
4
 14 Disclosing party may resist including the ability to rely on counsel’s advice in determining whether disclosure is
required. If the counsel concept is included, the disclosing party may alternatively request an opinion, or even a
written opinion.

 15 This provision is designed to prevent circumvention of the anti-use provision that would result if Buyer were to
take action that put it in a position where it was subject to a legal obligation to disclose Evaluation Material.
Similarly, Buyer may wish to prevent a “backdoor standstill” as a result of the anti-use provision through
language along the lines of the following: “Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
2, following the expiration of the Standstill Period nothing in this Agreement shall restrict, Buyer’s disclosure
of Evaluation Material or any Discussions Disclosure in connection with any of the actions described in Section
8(a)-(c) to the extent required by Applicable Law or the applicable rules or regulations of any national
securities exchange.”
16 Delete if neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates has any publicly traded securities. If both parties have
publicly traded securities, consider making this a reciprocal acknowledgement.

 17 Some recipients of confidential information, particularly institutional holders of distressed securities negotiating
with respect to potential restructurings, make it a priority to obtain agreement from the Company to a “cleansing
provision” under which the Company will publicize, through a Securities Act filing, press release or otherwise,
no later than a date certain, any information provided which, at the relevant date, remains material and nonpublic, in order that they may trade in securities of the Company. A sample cleansing provision is included as
Exhibit D to this letter.
18 Disclosing parties may reject the right to retain any copies.
19 Receiving parties will often take the position that any Evaluation Material that is retained should be subject to
the obligation of confidentiality only for the remainder of the term of the Agreement, with the argument being 
7
20 In certain instances, disclosing parties may insist on including a provision regarding the use of social media
websites to obtain information about the Company and its employees such as the following:
 Buyer agrees that neither it nor any of its Representatives shall use any third party or social media websites
to obtain information about the Company or its employees unless it takes reasonable precautions to
preserve the confidentiality of the Transaction and to avoid detection of the Transaction or disclosure of
any Evaluation Material or any information that if disclosed would constitute a Discussions Disclosure
other than as permitted by this Agreement. Reasonable precautions shall include (but are not limited to): (i)
selecting privacy settings that will protect the confidentiality of Buyer’s due diligence investigation on such
websites, (ii) restricting the use of such websites for the purpose of evaluating the Transaction to as limited
a working group as reasonably possible, (iii) avoiding the use of fictional accounts or similar practices
(whether or not there is any intent to deceive or harm the Company or its employees), and (iv) otherwise
complying with the contractual terms of use of such websites and any applicable federal and state laws.” 
21 Receiving parties may wish to provide an additional exception for “soliciting or hiring any such Person who
initially approaches the Buyer or its controlled Affiliate of his or her own accord.”
8
 22 Note that even after the standstill expires, the use restriction set forth in Section 2(a)(i) could be used as an
implicit standstill. See the footnote to Section 2(c)(iii) for a potential means to avoid such a “back door”
standstill.
23 If Buyer or an Affiliate already owns a significant amount of the target’s securities or loans, consider also
restricting sales.
24 The interplay of this clause (v) with the fall away provisions in Section 8(d) should be reviewed in light of
recent Delaware case law regarding “don’t ask/don’t waive” standstill provisions and whether other interested
parties who may have signed a Confidentiality Agreement with the Company that includes a standstill will be
allowed to make a competing proposal after Buyer and the Company enter into a definitive agreement. See In
re Complete Genomics, Inc. Shareholder Litigation, C.A. No. 7888-VCL (Del. Ch. Nov. 27, 2012) and In Re
Ancestry.com Inc. Shareholder Litigation, C.A. No. 7988-CS (Del. Ch. Dec. 17, 2012).

 25 This “fall away” provision is one of the most heavily debated issues in public company NDAs. On the one
hand, a prospective buyer does not want to have its hands tied if it fails to win the auction and wants to submit a
topping bid later. On the other hand, the target’s board of directors wants to obtain the best and final offers
from each bidder during the auction process and ensure nothing is being left in reserve by a bidder.
26 Receiving parties will often insist that equitable relief is at the discretion of the courts and that money damages
“may not” (as opposed to “would not”) be a sufficient remedy for a breach of the Agreement and the disclosing
party should be entitled to “seek” specific performance (as opposed to being entitled to specific performance).
It should be noted that , if a disclosing party were to agree to this alternative formulation, the usefulness of this
provision is limited because there is no explicit right to equitable relief. 
10
 27 Disclosing parties may choose not to include this provision in a first draft.
28 This bracketed language is only necessary if using the formulation that the confidentiality obligations last for so
long as the Evaluation Material is retained, as opposed to for the term of the Agreement.
29 The most common term is in the range of 12 to 24 months, because the information is likely to be stale
thereafter. However, if any of the Evaluation Material will be particularly sensitive, a longer term may be
appropriate for at least that portion of the Evaluation Material.
30 If the transaction involves direct competitors, consider including a provision as follows:
 Competing Activities. Subject to Buyer’s compliance with the express provisions of this Agreement, nothing in
this Agreement shall prevent Buyer or any of its Representatives from (a) evaluating a possible investment in
and/or collaborating with, or entering into any transaction with (including an investment in), or monitoring,
managing, maintaining or otherwise acting with respect to an investment in, any Person whose business is
similar to or competitive with the business of the Company and/or (b) engaging in, conducting or operating any
business that is similar to or competitive with the business of the Company. The Company acknowledges that
Buyer and its Representatives conduct business with many Persons, some of which may engage in or pursue
businesses and strategies that are similar to or competitive with those of the Company. Although Buyer is
subject to the obligations set forth in this Agreement, the occurrence or existence of such similar or competitive
activities shall not by itself be cause for any action or allegation by the Company that Buyer or any of its
Representatives has failed to observe any of the obligations set forth in this Agreement.

 31 The Company may want the governing law and forum to be the state where it is located.
