Exhibit D

SAMPLE “CLEANSING” PROVISION

(a) On the earlier of (i) ________, and (ii) [an event, such as the date of filing of a bankruptcy petition under title 11 of the United States Code by the Company] (such earlier date, the “Disclosure Date”), the Company shall publicly file a summary document (the “Cleansing Document”) which contains all written or oral Evaluation Material that constitutes material nonpublic information concerning the Company, its related parties and/or their respective securities that was provided at any time by the Company or its Representatives to Buyer or any of its Representatives (all such Evaluation Material being the “Disclosure Information”); provided that such Cleansing Document need not include any written information that was disclosed only to [counsel] pursuant to non-disclosure agreements with the Company shared on the basis of “professionals’ eyes only” or similar designation by the Company at the time of such disclosure. In the event that clause (ii) of the first sentence of this paragraph (a) applies, the Company shall publicly file the Cleansing Document reasonably contemporaneously with the occurrence of the event referenced in such clause (ii).

(b) As promptly as practicable and, in any event, by 5:30 p.m. New York City time on the second business day prior to the Disclosure Date, the Company will provide Buyer with a draft of the Cleansing Document. The Cleansing Document shall be on Form 8-K or any periodic report required or permitted to be filed under the Exchange Act with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) or, if the SEC’s EDGAR filing system is not available, in such other manner that the Company determines in good faith will result in public dissemination of such information. In the event that the Company fails to file the required Cleansing Document by the Disclosure Date or such Cleansing Document does not contain all of the Disclosure Information as determined by Buyer in its good faith judgment after consultation with internal or external counsel with regard to the requirements of applicable securities laws [and after consultation with the Company], then the Company agrees that, automatically and requiring no further act hereunder, and effective immediately on the Disclosure Date and for so long as such filing has not occurred (and notwithstanding if this Agreement has been terminated), Buyer or its Representatives (each an “Authorized Cleansing Party”) shall be authorized to make available to the public (with the reasonable fees of [counsel firm] and other reasonable expenses directly associated with such disclosure in connection therewith to be paid by the Company) a summary that reflects, in the Buyer’s good faith judgment after consultation with internal or external counsel with regard to the requirements of applicable securities laws, the Disclosure Information; provided that the Company has complied with its obligations as set forth in the first sentence of this paragraph (b), Buyer shall provide prior written notice to the Company of such disclosure by 5:30 p.m. New York City time on the second business day prior to such disclosure. The Company’s obligation for the payment of legal fees hereunder shall be limited to the reasonable fees of [counsel firm] only.

(c) None of Buyer or its Representatives shall have any liability to the Company in connection with the disclosure of the Disclosure Information as set forth in this Section.

(d) The Company shall, simultaneously with its filing of the Cleansing Document, represent in writing to Buyer that all information that the Company deems to be Disclosure Information has been publicly disclosed, and Buyer shall be entitled to rely upon such representation in all respects.

(e) Without limiting the parties’ rights under this Section, it is the parties’ current expectation that, with respect to business plans, term sheets, proposals and similar documents relating to a Transaction, only the most recent versions in any transactional construct (as such most recent versions may be orally supplemented) exchanged by each party to any negotiations would be included in the Disclosure Information.

(f) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyer’s sole and exclusive remedy for any breach by the Company of any representation, warranty, or covenant in this Section, except with respect to the Company’s obligation for the reasonable fees of counsel and other reasonable expenses directly associated with disclosure as set forth in paragraph (b), is to disclose the Disclosure Information as provided hereunder in accordance with the terms of paragraph (b), and neither the Company nor any of its affiliates or Representatives shall have any liability at law or in equity for any breach by the Company of its obligations pursuant to this Section.
