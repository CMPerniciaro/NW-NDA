Ladies and Gentlemen: 

We refer to the attached confidentiality agreement dated _________, 20__ (the “Confidentiality Agreement”) between [Name of Potential Buyer] (“Buyer”) and [Name of Target Company] (the “Company”). Capitalized terms used below that are defined in the Confidentiality Agreement are used with the meanings given such terms in the Confidentiality Agreement. The undersigned is a Representative of Buyer (“Buyer’s Representative”). Buyer’s Representative hereby agrees, for the benefit of Buyer and the Company (an explicit third-party beneficiary to this Agreement), to be bound on behalf of itself and its Representatives by the obligations with respect to Buyer’s Representatives contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (the “Obligations”) as if it were a party thereto. 

The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the signing of this agreement (this “Agreement”) does not obligate any Person to enter into the Transaction or to provide financing for the Transaction. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyer’s Representative shall not be restricted from being engaged or mandated by, or otherwise assisting or participating with, any other Person in any transaction that is similar to or competitive with the Transaction, but Buyer’s Representative must comply with the Obligations as provided herein. Additionally, nothing herein or in the Confidentiality Agreement shall prohibit Buyer’s Representative from disclosing to any third party who contacts Buyer’s Representative with respect to a transaction that is similar to or competitive with the Transaction, the fact that it is working with another Person with respect to a transaction with the Company, so long as it keeps confidential the identity of Buyer and otherwise complies with the Obligations. 

No failure or delay by Buyer or the Company in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof or preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder. 

[Buyer’s Representative agrees that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for a breach or a threatened breach of this Agreement and that Buyer and the Company shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief without the posting of a bond or other security as a remedy for any such breach or threatened breach, in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity.] Such injunctive or other equitable relief shall be available without the obligation to prove any damages underlying such breach or threatened breach. [In the event of any legal proceedings for the enforcement of this Agreement, the  reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the prevailing party and its Representatives as determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction in connection with such proceedings, including attorney fees and disbursements, shall be reimbursed by the non-prevailing party.] 

This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York without regard to the principles of conflicts of laws in any jurisdiction. Each party consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the [State of New York] located in the [Borough of Manhattan in New York City and the courts of the United States located in the Borough of Manhattan in New York City in the State of New York] for the adjudication of any action or legal proceeding relating to or arising out of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (and each party agrees not to commence any action or legal proceeding relating thereto except in any such court). Each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue in such courts and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action or legal proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each party hereby agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail addressed to such party shall be effective service of process for any such suit, action or proceeding brought against such party in any such court. Each party hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court shall be conclusive and binding upon such party and may be enforced in any other courts to whose jurisdiction such party is or may be subject by suit upon such judgment. 

EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT. 

This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts (including by PDF) with the same effect as if the signatures to each counterpart were upon a single instrument, and all such counterparts together shall be deemed an original of this Agreement.
