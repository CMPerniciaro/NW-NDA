New York City Bar Association Model Form of NonDisclosure Agreement
Corporation Law Committee
February 2015 
Prepared by the Corporation Law Committee of the New York City Bar Association1
[Name of the Company]2
[Address of the Company]
[Date]
[Name and Address of Potential Buyer]
Attention: [Name]
Dear [Name]:
[Potential Buyer] (“Buyer”) has requested certain non-public information regarding [Target
Company] and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) in connection with a potential
[negotiated]3 transaction (the “Transaction”) between or among Buyer, the Company and/or one
or more Affiliates of Buyer. As a condition to furnishing such information to Buyer, the
Company and Buyer hereby agree to the following provisions:4
1. Certain Definitions. As used in this letter agreement (this “Agreement”):
(a) “Affiliate” means, with respect to any Person, any other Person that is
directly or indirectly Controlling, Controlled by or under common Control with such
Person, where “Control” and derivative terms mean the possession, directly or indirectly,
of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person,
whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.
[Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of Section 7, any such Person that is a
portfolio company of, or an investment fund that is advised or managed by, [Buyer]
[Buyer’s Parent Company] or any of its Affiliates shall not be considered an Affiliate of
 1
 This form was prepared in January 2015 by the Corporation Law Committee of the New York City Bar
Association as a model for a unilateral confidentiality agreement (i.e., to be used when confidential information
is being disclosed by only one party). The draft attempts to reflect the Committee’s view of terms that may be
acceptable to both a buyer and a seller, with additional commentary provided on often-negotiated provisions.
Of course, careful attention to specific facts and client needs is always advisable.
2
 This form has been drafted assuming the target company is the disclosing party. If a selling equityholder is also
a disclosing party, conforming changes should be made throughout to also reference the selling equityholder, as
appropriate.
3
 The disclosing party may want to insert the word “negotiated” to make clear that the information may only be
used in a consensual transaction (particularly if a standstill is not included). See Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.
v. Vulcan Materials Co., 56 A 3d 1072 (Del Ch. 2012) and Goodrich Capital, LLC and Windsor Sheffield & Co.
Inc. v. Vector Capital Corporation (S.D.N.Y. June 26, 2012).
4
 If the potential Buyer is a competitor of the Company, the parties often will establish a “clean team” or
“attorneys eyes only” protocol for dealing with competitively sensitive information and will enter into a
“Common Interest Agreement.” Parties are encouraged to coordinate the provisions of any Common Interest
Agreement with the provisions of their confidentiality agreement. Discontinuity between the terms of the two
agreements created issues for the parties in Martin Marietta Materials. In addition, please see the footnote to
Section 13 regarding an additional covenant to consider in the event that Buyer and the Company are
competitors. 
2
Buyer unless Evaluation Material or Discussions Disclosure is made available or actually
provided or disclosed to such Person by or on behalf of Buyer; provided that Evaluation
Material or Discussions Disclosure shall not be deemed to have been made available or
actually provided or disclosed to any such Person solely as a result of the fact that a
Representative of the Buyer with knowledge of any Evaluation Material or Discussions
Disclosure is serving on the board of directors (or similar governing body) or as an
officer of such Person.]5
(b) “Evaluation Material” means any information or data concerning the
Company or any of its Affiliates, whether in oral, visual, written, electronic or other
form, that is disclosed to Buyer or any of its Representatives [before the date hereof,]6
now or in the future by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Representatives,
together with all notes, memoranda, forecasts, summaries, analyses, compilations and
other writings relating thereto that are prepared by or on behalf of Buyer or any of its
Representatives to the extent that they use, contain, reflect or are derived from or
incorporate, in whole or in part, any such information or data. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, “Evaluation Material” does not include any information or data that: (i) is or
was independently developed by Buyer or any of its Representatives without the benefit
of any Evaluation Material;7
 (ii) is or becomes generally available to the public, other
than as a result of disclosure by or on behalf of Buyer or any of its Representatives in
breach of this Agreement; (iii) is or becomes available to Buyer [on a non-confidential
basis]8
 from a source other than the Company or any of its Representatives, so long as
that source[, to Buyer’s knowledge after reasonable inquiry,]9
 is not bound by a legal,
contractual or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to the Company; or (iv) is already in
Buyer’s possession at the time of disclosure by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
Representatives[ as shown by Buyer’s records immediately prior to the time of
disclosure]10 from a source other than the Company or any of its Representatives, so long
as that source[, to Buyer’s knowledge after reasonable inquiry,]11 is not bound by a legal,
contractual or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to the Company.
(c) “including” means “including, without limitation.”
 5
 This bracketed language is only applicable for private equity-type buyers that have other portfolio companies
(or to buyers that are themselves portfolio companies).
6
 Receiving parties may resist including information disclosed prior to the date of the Confidentiality Agreement
depending upon the facts and circumstances.
7
 Disclosing parties may wish to state that “Buyer shall have the burden of proof to demonstrate the absence of
reliance on Evaluation Material.”
8
 Receiving parties may resist including this bracketed language because they may receive information from
sources on a confidential basis (e.g., information may be received from a consultant and there may be an
obligation of confidentiality in the engagement letter with such consultant).
9
 Disclosing parties may resist any knowledge qualifier, and where one is included, receiving parties may resist
an inquiry obligation.
10 Receiving parties may wish to exclude an evidentiary requirement.
11 Disclosing parties may resist any knowledge qualifier, and where one is included, receiving parties may resist
an inquiry obligation. 
3
(d) “Person” means any natural person, business, corporation, company,
association, limited liability company, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability
partnership, joint venture, business enterprise, trust, governmental authority or other legal
entity.
(e) “Representatives” means, with respect to any Person, the Affiliates of such
Person and any of its and their respective directors, officers, employees, managing
members, general partners, attorneys, accountants, investment bankers, financial
advisors, consultants and other advisors[, and any actual or potential sources of debt
financing for such Person or its Affiliates]12; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, in
no event shall any actual or potential sources of equity financing for Buyer or its
Affiliates be considered a “Representative” of Buyer for purposes of this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the Company.
2. Confidentiality, Use and Disclosure of Evaluation Material.
(a) Confidentiality and Use of Evaluation Material. Buyer agrees that Buyer
and its Representatives shall (i) use the Evaluation Material solely for the purpose of
evaluating, negotiating and consummating the Transaction (or other legal, audit or
compliance purposes permitted by this Agreement);13 (ii) except as otherwise permitted
by this Section 2, keep all Evaluation Material strictly confidential; and (iii) disclose
Evaluation Material only to Representatives of Buyer to whom disclosure is needed to
facilitate the evaluation, negotiation and/or consummation of the Transaction. Before
Buyer or any of its Representatives provides access to any Evaluation Material to any of
its Representatives, Buyer agrees that it or one of its Representatives shall inform such
Representative of the provisions of this Agreement and instruct it to comply with the
provisions hereof applicable to its Representatives. Buyer shall be liable for any breaches
of this Agreement by its Representatives, except for breaches committed by any
Representative that is party to either (a) a separate joinder agreement in the form set forth
as Exhibit C hereto or (b) a separate mutually acceptable confidentiality agreement
between such Representative and the Company with respect to the Evaluation Material.
(b) Discussions Disclosure. Without the prior written consent of the Company,
neither the Buyer nor any of its Representatives shall: (i) make any disclosure to any
other Person (other than its Representatives to whom disclosure is needed to facilitate the
evaluation, negotiation and/or consummation of the Transaction) of (A) the fact that
 12 Parties to consider whether it is appropriate to include debt financing sources in the definition of
Representatives. To the extent debt financing sources are included, it should be considered whether reference
should be generic or whether specific “approved” debt financing sources should be listed on an exhibit.
Similarly, if the Buyer is contemplating having potential co-bidders, consider including a concept of “Permitted
Co-Bidders” and allowing for disclosure of Evaluation Material to Permitted Co-Bidders. Potential definition
of “Permitted Co-Bidder” would be as follows: “Permitted Co-Bidder” means any Person (and any Affiliates of
such Person) who may invest in the Transaction on a side-by-side basis with Buyer, if such Person (or its
Affiliate) [(i)] has executed its own confidentiality agreement with respect to the Transaction with the Company
[and (ii) is listed on Exhibit __]. Note that if the “Permitted Co-Bidder” concept is included, the last proviso in
the definition should be deleted.
13 Disclosing party should consider whether specific exceptions to the use restriction are appropriate. 
4
investigations, discussions or negotiations are taking or have taken place concerning the
Transaction, (B) the existence or contents of this Agreement, (C) the fact that Buyer or
any of its Representatives has requested or received Evaluation Material, conducted due
diligence or attended management meetings or site visits with the Company or any of its
Representatives or is otherwise considering the Transaction or (D) any of the terms,
conditions or facts relating to the Transaction, including the status thereof; or (ii) make
any public statement concerning the Transaction. Without the prior written consent of
Buyer, neither the Company nor any of its Representatives shall make any disclosure to
any other Person (other than its Representatives) of the fact that Buyer or any of its
Representatives has requested or received Evaluation Material, conducted due diligence
or attended management meetings or site visits with the Company or any of its
Representatives or is otherwise considering the Transaction (other than on an anonymous
basis) or any other information that may reasonably be expected to lead to disclosure of
Buyer’s identity (any disclosure or statement prohibited by the two preceding sentences
being “Discussions Disclosure”).
(c) Compulsory Disclosure.
(i) If Buyer or any of its Representatives or the Company or any of
its Representatives (in the case of Discussions Disclosure) is requested or required
by interrogatories, requests for information from a governmental, regulatory or
supervisory authority, deposition, subpoena or similar legal process to disclose
any Evaluation Material or Discussions Disclosure, or disclosure of Evaluation
Material or Discussions Disclosure is required [based on the advice of counsel]14
for Buyer or any of its Representatives or the Company or any of its
Representatives in order not to be in violation of any applicable law, regulation,
order or other similar requirement of any governmental, regulatory or supervisory
authority or any applicable listing agreement (collectively, “Applicable Law” and
such required disclosing party, the “Compulsory Disclosing Party”), the
Compulsory Disclosing Party shall provide the other party with prompt prior
written notice thereof, to the extent not prohibited by Applicable Law, so that the
other party may seek an appropriate protective order and/or, in the sole discretion
of the other party, waive compliance by the Compulsory Disclosing Party with the
applicable provisions of this Agreement.
(ii) If, in the absence of such a protective order or waiver, the
Compulsory Disclosing Party is nonetheless legally compelled to disclose any
Evaluation Material or Discussions Disclosure [based on the advice of counsel],
then the Compulsory Disclosing Party may, without liability under this
Agreement, disclose only such portion of the Evaluation Material or make only
such Discussions Disclosure as is legally required to be disclosed [based on the
advice of counsel]; provided that the Compulsory Disclosing Party agrees to use
reasonable efforts, at the other party’s expense, to obtain assurances that any such
 14 Disclosing party may resist including the ability to rely on counsel’s advice in determining whether disclosure is
required. If the counsel concept is included, the disclosing party may alternatively request an opinion, or even a
written opinion. 
5
disclosed Evaluation Material and Discussions Disclosure will be afforded
confidential treatment.
(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt,
none of Buyer or any of its Representatives shall be permitted to make any
disclosure of Evaluation Material or Discussions Disclosure if Buyer or any of its
Representatives has, without the prior written consent of the Company’s board of
directors, initiated any proxy contest, tender offer, other effort to enter into a
business combination with the Company, or any plan or proposal described in
Item 4 of Schedule 13D, or taken any other action in violation of Section 8, that
would reasonably be expected to trigger such requirement of disclosure.15
(iv) The Company acknowledges that Buyer has advised the
Company that [Buyer is, and] certain of its Representatives may be, registered
investment advisers or regulated financial institutions and thus subject to routine
examinations, investigations, regulatory sweeps or other regulatory inquiries.
Buyer and its Representatives shall not be required to comply with the process
described in paragraphs (i) and (ii) above in respect of disclosures made to a
regulatory agency, self-regulatory organization, governmental agency or examiner
thereof in the course of any such routine examinations, investigations, sweeps or
inquiries, and any such disclosure shall be permitted.
(d) Disclosure Permitted to Defend Dispute. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 2, Buyer or any of its Representatives and the Company or any
of its Representatives (in the case of Discussions Disclosure) may disclose Evaluation
Material or Discussions Disclosure to the extent necessary to defend any litigation claim
or cause of action brought against it by the other party relating to the Transaction;
provided that the disclosing party agrees to use (and to cause its applicable
Representatives to use) reasonable efforts, at the other party’s expense, to obtain
assurances that any such disclosed Evaluation Material and Discussions Disclosure will
be afforded confidential treatment.
3. [Securities Law Restrictions.
 16 Buyer acknowledges that: (a) the Evaluation Material
and information that, if disclosed, would constitute Discussions Disclosure may contain
material non-public information concerning the Company and its Affiliates; and (b)
Buyer is aware of the restrictions imposed by U.S. federal and state securities laws, and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, on Persons in possession of material
 15 This provision is designed to prevent circumvention of the anti-use provision that would result if Buyer were to
take action that put it in a position where it was subject to a legal obligation to disclose Evaluation Material.
Similarly, Buyer may wish to prevent a “backdoor standstill” as a result of the anti-use provision through
language along the lines of the following: “Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
2, following the expiration of the Standstill Period nothing in this Agreement shall restrict, Buyer’s disclosure
of Evaluation Material or any Discussions Disclosure in connection with any of the actions described in Section
8(a)-(c) to the extent required by Applicable Law or the applicable rules or regulations of any national
securities exchange.”
16 Delete if neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates has any publicly traded securities. If both parties have
publicly traded securities, consider making this a reciprocal acknowledgement. 
6
non-public information. Nothing herein shall constitute an admission by either party that
any Evaluation Material or other such information in fact contains material non-public
information concerning the Company or any of its Affiliates.]17
4. No Representations or Warranties. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that: (a) no
representation or warranty, express or implied, is made by the Company or any of its
Representatives as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the Evaluation Material; and
(b) Buyer shall be entitled to rely only on those representations and warranties that are
expressly set forth in any definitive written agreement that is hereafter executed and
delivered by both Buyer or its Affiliate and the Company in connection with the
Transaction (a “Definitive Transaction Agreement”). Except as may be expressly set
forth in a Definitive Transaction Agreement, none of the Company or any of its
Representatives shall have any liability to Buyer or any of its Representatives on account
of the use of any Evaluation Material by Buyer or any of its Representatives or any
inaccuracy therein or omission therefrom.
5. Destruction or Erasure of Evaluation Material. At any time upon the Company’s
written request (including by email), Buyer agrees that Buyer and its Representatives
shall promptly destroy or erase all Evaluation Material (including any Evaluation
Material held electronically) in the possession or control of Buyer or any of its
Representatives, and Buyer shall, if requested in writing (including by email) by the
Company, certify such destruction or erasure to the Company; provided that (a) neither
Buyer nor any of its Representatives shall be required to destroy or erase any electronic
copy of any Evaluation Material that is created pursuant to such Person’s standard
electronic backup and archival procedures if (x) personnel whose functions are not
primarily information technology in nature do not have access to such retained copies and
(y) personnel whose functions are primarily information technology in nature have access
to such copies only as reasonably necessary for the performance of their information
technology duties (e.g., for purposes of system recovery) and [(b) Buyer and its
Representatives may each retain (i) one copy of any Evaluation Material to the extent
required to defend or maintain any litigation relating to this Agreement or the Evaluation
Material, or to comply with its established document retention policies and (ii) such
copies of the Evaluation Material to the extent required to comply with requirements of
Applicable Law.]18 All such Evaluation Material retained in accordance with the
foregoing proviso shall continue to be subject to Section 2 [for so long as any Evaluation
Material is so retained].19
 17 Some recipients of confidential information, particularly institutional holders of distressed securities negotiating
with respect to potential restructurings, make it a priority to obtain agreement from the Company to a “cleansing
provision” under which the Company will publicize, through a Securities Act filing, press release or otherwise,
no later than a date certain, any information provided which, at the relevant date, remains material and nonpublic, in order that they may trade in securities of the Company. A sample cleansing provision is included as
Exhibit D to this letter.
18 Disclosing parties may reject the right to retain any copies.
19 Receiving parties will often take the position that any Evaluation Material that is retained should be subject to
the obligation of confidentiality only for the remainder of the term of the Agreement, with the argument being 
7
6. Communications Regarding the Transaction. Buyer agrees that all communications
by it or any of its Representatives with the other Party concerning the Transaction and its
due diligence investigation (including requests for additional Evaluation Material,
meetings with management and site visits) shall be directed solely to
[___________________], except as may otherwise be approved in advance and in
writing (including by email) by the Company. Buyer agrees that neither Buyer nor any of
its Representatives will contact or communicate with any of the directors, officers,
employees, customers, suppliers, distributors, licensees, licensors and clients of the
Company, and other persons, including governmental agencies, having business relations
with the Company, regarding the Company or the Transaction, in each case except to the
extent such contacts and communications are (i) made in the ordinary course of business
of Buyer or the applicable Representatives and are unrelated to the Transaction and the
evaluation of the Transaction conducted by Buyer and its Representatives or (ii) approved
in advance and in writing (including by email) by the Company.20
7. [No Solicitation or Hiring. Buyer agrees that, except with the prior written consent of
the Company, it will not, and it will not permit any of its controlled Affiliates to, directly
or indirectly, solicit for employment or hire any [employees/officers/senior management
of the Company [first introduced to Buyer or any of its controlled Affiliates in connection
with the evaluation of the Transaction][that first become known to Buyer or any of its
controlled Affiliates in connection with Buyer’s evaluation of the Transaction][listed on
Exhibit A]] for a period of [___] year[s] after the date of this Agreement; provided that
this Section 7 shall not restrict Buyer or any of its controlled Affiliates from (i) making
any general solicitation for employment that is not specifically directed at any such
Persons, including through use of a recruiting website or employment search firm (so
long as the firm is not instructed to solicit such Persons) or from hiring any Person as a
result thereof or (ii) soliciting or hiring any such Person who [has left the employment of
the Company][was terminated by the Company] at least [___] months prior to such
solicitation or being hired.21

that the information becomes stale and the receiving party does not want lingering contractual obligations. In
that case, the bracketed language would be replaced with: “during the term of this Agreement.”
20 In certain instances, disclosing parties may insist on including a provision regarding the use of social media
websites to obtain information about the Company and its employees such as the following:
 Buyer agrees that neither it nor any of its Representatives shall use any third party or social media websites
to obtain information about the Company or its employees unless it takes reasonable precautions to
preserve the confidentiality of the Transaction and to avoid detection of the Transaction or disclosure of
any Evaluation Material or any information that if disclosed would constitute a Discussions Disclosure
other than as permitted by this Agreement. Reasonable precautions shall include (but are not limited to): (i)
selecting privacy settings that will protect the confidentiality of Buyer’s due diligence investigation on such
websites, (ii) restricting the use of such websites for the purpose of evaluating the Transaction to as limited
a working group as reasonably possible, (iii) avoiding the use of fictional accounts or similar practices
(whether or not there is any intent to deceive or harm the Company or its employees), and (iv) otherwise
complying with the contractual terms of use of such websites and any applicable federal and state laws.” 21 Receiving parties may wish to provide an additional exception for “soliciting or hiring any such Person who
initially approaches the Buyer or its controlled Affiliate of his or her own accord.”
8
8. [Standstill. Unless approved in advance in writing by the board of directors of the
Company, Buyer agrees that neither Buyer nor any of its Representatives acting on behalf
of or in concert with Buyer in this regard will, for a period of [___] year[s] after the date
of this Agreement (the “Standstill Period”)22, directly or indirectly:
(a) make any statement or proposal to the board of directors of the Company,
any of the Company’s Representatives or any of the Company’s stockholders regarding,
or make any public announcement, proposal or offer (including any “solicitation” of
“proxies” as such terms are defined or used in Regulation 14A of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) with respect to, or otherwise solicit, seek
or offer to effect (including, for the avoidance of doubt, indirectly by means of
communication with the press or media) (i) any business combination, merger, tender
offer, exchange offer or similar transaction involving the Company, (ii) any restructuring,
recapitalization, liquidation or similar transaction involving the Company, (iii) any
acquisition23 (or proposal or agreement to acquire), of record or beneficially, by purchase
or otherwise, any [loans, debt securities,] equity securities or assets of the Company, or
rights or options to acquire interests in, or any swap or other arrangement that results in
the economic consequences of ownership of, the Company’s [loans, debt securities,]
equity securities or assets, except that Buyer may beneficially own up to [___]% [of each
class] [in the aggregate] of the Company’s outstanding [loans, debt securities and] equity
securities and may own an amount in excess of such percentage solely to the extent
resulting exclusively from actions taken by the Company (e.g., a repurchase of securities
by the Company), (iv) any proposal to seek representation on the board of directors of the
Company or otherwise control or influence the management, board of directors or
policies of the Company, (v) any request or proposal to waive, terminate or amend the
provisions of this Agreement24 or (vi) any proposal, arrangement or other statement that
is inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, including this Section 8(a);
(b) instigate, encourage or assist any third party (including forming a “group”
(as such term is used under the Exchange Act) with any such third party) to do, or enter
into any discussions or agreements with any third party with respect to, any of the actions
set forth in clause (a) above; or
 22 Note that even after the standstill expires, the use restriction set forth in Section 2(a)(i) could be used as an
implicit standstill. See the footnote to Section 2(c)(iii) for a potential means to avoid such a “back door”
standstill.
23 If Buyer or an Affiliate already owns a significant amount of the target’s securities or loans, consider also
restricting sales.
24 The interplay of this clause (v) with the fall away provisions in Section 8(d) should be reviewed in light of
recent Delaware case law regarding “don’t ask/don’t waive” standstill provisions and whether other interested
parties who may have signed a Confidentiality Agreement with the Company that includes a standstill will be
allowed to make a competing proposal after Buyer and the Company enter into a definitive agreement. See In
re Complete Genomics, Inc. Shareholder Litigation, C.A. No. 7888-VCL (Del. Ch. Nov. 27, 2012) and In Re
Ancestry.com Inc. Shareholder Litigation, C.A. No. 7988-CS (Del. Ch. Dec. 17, 2012). 
9
(c) take any action which would reasonably be expected to require the
Company or any of its Affiliates to make a public announcement regarding any of the
actions set forth in clause (a) above.
[As of the date of this Agreement, the amount of [TYPE OF SECURITIES/LOANS] of
the Company beneficially owned by Buyer and each of its Affiliates is as set forth
opposite the name of such Person under the heading “Amount Beneficially Owned” [with
respect to each such [security] [loan]] on Exhibit B.]
(d) [Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 8:
(i) the restrictions set forth in this Section 8 shall terminate and be of
no further force and effect if the Company enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to, or publicly announces that it plans to enter into, or otherwise has
recommended that the Company’s stockholders accept or approve, a transaction
involving the acquisition by any Person or “group” of beneficial ownership of all
or a controlling portion of the Company’s equity securities or all or substantially
all of the Companies’ assets (whether by merger, consolidation, business
combination, tender or exchange offer, recapitalization, restructuring, sale, equity
issuance or otherwise);]25
(ii) nothing in this Section 8 shall restrict Buyer or any of its
Representatives from making any proposal regarding a possible Transaction
directly to the board of directors of the Company on a confidential basis if such
proposal does not require the Company to make a public announcement regarding
this Agreement, a possible Transaction or any of the matters described in this
Section 8; and
(iii) Buyer and its Representatives may purchase goods or services of
the Company or submit proposals for the purchase or sale of goods or services to
or otherwise deal with the Company in the ordinary course of business.]
9. Remedies. Each party agrees that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for a
breach or a threatened breach of this Agreement and that each party shall be entitled to
specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief, without the posting of a
bond or other security, as a remedy for any such breach or threatened breach, in addition
to all other remedies available at law or in equity.26 Such injunctive or other equitable
relief shall be available without the obligation to prove any damages underlying such
 25 This “fall away” provision is one of the most heavily debated issues in public company NDAs. On the one
hand, a prospective buyer does not want to have its hands tied if it fails to win the auction and wants to submit a
topping bid later. On the other hand, the target’s board of directors wants to obtain the best and final offers
from each bidder during the auction process and ensure nothing is being left in reserve by a bidder.
26 Receiving parties will often insist that equitable relief is at the discretion of the courts and that money damages
“may not” (as opposed to “would not”) be a sufficient remedy for a breach of the Agreement and the disclosing
party should be entitled to “seek” specific performance (as opposed to being entitled to specific performance).
It should be noted that , if a disclosing party were to agree to this alternative formulation, the usefulness of this
provision is limited because there is no explicit right to equitable relief. 
10
breach or threatened breach. [In the event of any legal proceedings for the enforcement
of this Agreement, the reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the prevailing party and
its Representatives as determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction in connection with such proceedings, including attorney fees and
disbursements, shall be reimbursed by the non-prevailing party.]
10. No Waiver of Privilege. To the extent that any Evaluation Material includes materials
subject to the attorney-client privilege, such disclosure is inadvertent and the Company is
not waiving, and shall not be deemed to have waived or diminished, its attorney workproduct protections, attorney-client privileges or similar protections and privileges as a
result of disclosing any Evaluation Material (including Evaluation Material related to
pending or threatened litigation) to Buyer or any of its Representatives.
11. Residual Knowledge. The parties acknowledge and agree that Representatives of Buyer
who have received or have been exposed to Evaluation Material may further develop
their general knowledge, skills and experience (including general ideas, concepts, knowhow and techniques), which may be based in whole or in part on such Evaluation
Material. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the subsequent
use by such Representative of such general knowledge, skills and experience, as retained
in their unaided memories, will not in itself constitute a breach of this Agreement.27
12. Term. Except for Sections 13(i) (Governing Law; Forum), 13(j) (WAIVER OF JURY
TRIAL) and 13(k) (Conflict Waiver), which shall be binding in perpetuity or until the
latest date permitted by Applicable Law, [the last sentence of Section 5]28 and Sections 7
and 8 which shall survive in accordance with their respective terms, this Agreement shall
expire upon the date that is [___] year[s] after the date of this Agreement.29
13. Miscellaneous.30
 27 Disclosing parties may choose not to include this provision in a first draft.
28 This bracketed language is only necessary if using the formulation that the confidentiality obligations last for so
long as the Evaluation Material is retained, as opposed to for the term of the Agreement.
29 The most common term is in the range of 12 to 24 months, because the information is likely to be stale
thereafter. However, if any of the Evaluation Material will be particularly sensitive, a longer term may be
appropriate for at least that portion of the Evaluation Material.
30 If the transaction involves direct competitors, consider including a provision as follows:
 Competing Activities. Subject to Buyer’s compliance with the express provisions of this Agreement, nothing in
this Agreement shall prevent Buyer or any of its Representatives from (a) evaluating a possible investment in
and/or collaborating with, or entering into any transaction with (including an investment in), or monitoring,
managing, maintaining or otherwise acting with respect to an investment in, any Person whose business is
similar to or competitive with the business of the Company and/or (b) engaging in, conducting or operating any
business that is similar to or competitive with the business of the Company. The Company acknowledges that
Buyer and its Representatives conduct business with many Persons, some of which may engage in or pursue
businesses and strategies that are similar to or competitive with those of the Company. Although Buyer is
subject to the obligations set forth in this Agreement, the occurrence or existence of such similar or competitive
activities shall not by itself be cause for any action or allegation by the Company that Buyer or any of its
Representatives has failed to observe any of the obligations set forth in this Agreement. 
11
(a) Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the sole and entire agreement
between the parties with respect to the matters set forth herein.
(b) Data Site Provision. The terms of this Agreement shall control over any
additional purported confidentiality requirements imposed by any offering memorandum,
web-based database or similar repository of Evaluation Material to which Buyer or any of
its Representatives is granted access in connection with the evaluation, negotiation or
consummation of the Transaction, notwithstanding acceptance of such an offering
memorandum or submission of an electronic signature, “clicking” on an “I Agree” icon
or other indication of assent to such additional confidentiality conditions, it being
understood and agreed that the confidentiality obligations with respect to Evaluation
Material are exclusively governed by this Agreement and may not be enlarged except in
accordance with Section 13(f).
(c) Ownership of Evaluation Material; No License. All Evaluation Material is
and shall remain property of the Company. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that none of
the Company nor any of its Representatives grants any license to or other property right
or interest in, by implication or otherwise, any copyright, patent, trademark, mask work,
database or other intellectual or intangible property or proprietary information disclosed,
embodied, fixed, comprised or contained in any Evaluation Material.
(d) No Financing Exclusivity. Buyer hereby represents and warrants that it is
not party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding (whether written or oral) that
would restrict the ability of any other person to provide financing (debt, equity or
otherwise) to any other person for the Transaction or any similar transaction, and Buyer
hereby agrees that it will not directly or indirectly restrict the ability of any other person
to provide any such financing.
(e) Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted

only by a separate written instrument duly signed and delivered by or on behalf of both
Buyer and the Company. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power
or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or privilege hereunder.
(g) Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this
Agreement shall not impair or affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision
of this Agreement, unless the enforcement of such other provision in such circumstances
would be inequitable.

without regard to the principles of conflicts of laws in any jurisdiction. Each party
consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the [State of New York

for the adjudication of any action or legal proceeding relating to or arising out of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (and each party agrees not to
commence any action or legal proceeding relating thereto except in any such court).

now or hereafter have to the laying of venue in such courts and agrees not to plead or
claim in any such court that any such action or legal proceeding brought in any such court
has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each party hereby agrees that service of any

the address set forth above (or such other address as notified by either party to the other
party in writing) shall be effective service of process for any such suit, action or
proceeding brought against such party in any such court. Each party hereto agrees that a

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We refer to the attached confidentiality agreement dated _________, 20__ (the “Confidentiality
Agreement”) between [Name of Potential Buyer] (“Buyer”) and [Name of Target Company] (the
“Company”). Capitalized terms used below that are defined in the Confidentiality Agreement
are used with the meanings given such terms in the Confidentiality Agreement.
The undersigned is a Representative of Buyer (“Buyer’s Representative”). Buyer’s
Representative hereby agrees, for the benefit of Buyer and the Company (an explicit third-party
beneficiary to this Agreement), to be bound on behalf of itself and its Representatives by the
obligations with respect to Buyer’s Representatives contained in the Confidentiality Agreement
(the “Obligations”) as if it were a party thereto.
The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the signing of this agreement (this “Agreement”)
does not obligate any Person to enter into the Transaction or to provide financing for the
Transaction. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyer’s Representative shall not be restricted
from being engaged or mandated by, or otherwise assisting or participating with, any other
Person in any transaction that is similar to or competitive with the Transaction, but Buyer’s
Representative must comply with the Obligations as provided herein. Additionally, nothing
herein or in the Confidentiality Agreement shall prohibit Buyer’s Representative from disclosing
to any third party who contacts Buyer’s Representative with respect to a transaction that is
similar to or competitive with the Transaction, the fact that it is working with another Person
with respect to a transaction with the Company, so long as it keeps confidential the identity of
Buyer and otherwise complies with the Obligations.
No failure or delay by Buyer or the Company in exercising any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof or preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder.
[Buyer’s Representative agrees that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for a
breach or a threatened breach of this Agreement and that Buyer and the Company shall be
entitled to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief without the posting of a
bond or other security as a remedy for any such breach or threatened breach, in addition to all
other remedies available at law or in equity.] Such injunctive or other equitable relief shall be
available without the obligation to prove any damages underlying such breach or threatened
breach. [In the event of any legal proceedings for the enforcement of this Agreement, the 

reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the prevailing party and its Representatives as
determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction in
connection with such proceedings, including attorney fees and disbursements, shall be
reimbursed by the non-prevailing party.]
This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract or tort) that may be
based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance
of this Agreement, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State
of New York without regard to the principles of conflicts of laws in any jurisdiction. Each party
consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the [State of New York]
located in the [Borough of Manhattan in New York City and the courts of the United States
located in the Borough of Manhattan in New York City in the State of New York] for the
adjudication of any action or legal proceeding relating to or arising out of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (and each party agrees not to commence any action or legal
proceeding relating thereto except in any such court). Each party hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue
in such courts and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action or legal
proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each party
hereby agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail
addressed to such party shall be effective service of process for any such suit, action or
proceeding brought against such party in any such court. Each party hereto agrees that a final
judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court shall be conclusive
and binding upon such party and may be enforced in any other courts to whose jurisdiction such
party is or may be subject by suit upon such judgment.
EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT.
This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts (including by PDF) with the same
effect as if the signatures to each counterpart were upon a single instrument, and all such
counterparts together shall be deemed an original of this Agreement.

Exhibit D
SAMPLE “CLEANSING” PROVISION
(a) On the earlier of (i) ________, and (ii) [an event, such as the date of filing of a
bankruptcy petition under title 11 of the United States Code by the Company] (such earlier date,
the “Disclosure Date”), the Company shall publicly file a summary document (the “Cleansing
Document”) which contains all written or oral Evaluation Material that constitutes material nonpublic information concerning the Company, its related parties and/or their respective securities
that was provided at any time by the Company or its Representatives to Buyer or any of its
Representatives (all such Evaluation Material being the “Disclosure Information”); provided that
such Cleansing Document need not include any written information that was disclosed only to
[counsel] pursuant to non-disclosure agreements with the Company shared on the basis of
“professionals’ eyes only” or similar designation by the Company at the time of such
disclosure. In the event that clause (ii) of the first sentence of this paragraph (a) applies, the
Company shall publicly file the Cleansing Document reasonably contemporaneously with the
occurrence of the event referenced in such clause (ii).
(b) As promptly as practicable and, in any event, by 5:30 p.m. New York City time on
the second business day prior to the Disclosure Date, the Company will provide Buyer with a
draft of the Cleansing Document. The Cleansing Document shall be on Form 8-K or any
periodic report required or permitted to be filed under the Exchange Act with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) or, if the SEC’s EDGAR filing system is not available, in
such other manner that the Company determines in good faith will result in public dissemination
of such information. In the event that the Company fails to file the required Cleansing
Document by the Disclosure Date or such Cleansing Document does not contain all of the
Disclosure Information as determined by Buyer in its good faith judgment after consultation with
internal or external counsel with regard to the requirements of applicable securities laws [and
after consultation with the Company], then the Company agrees that, automatically and requiring
no further act hereunder, and effective immediately on the Disclosure Date and for so long as
such filing has not occurred (and notwithstanding if this Agreement has been terminated), Buyer
or its Representatives (each an “Authorized Cleansing Party”) shall be authorized to make
available to the public (with the reasonable fees of [counsel firm] and other reasonable expenses
directly associated with such disclosure in connection therewith to be paid by the Company) a
summary that reflects, in the Buyer’s good faith judgment after consultation with internal or
external counsel with regard to the requirements of applicable securities laws, the Disclosure
Information; provided that the Company has complied with its obligations as set forth in the first
sentence of this paragraph (b), Buyer shall provide prior written notice to the Company of such
disclosure by 5:30 p.m. New York City time on the second business day prior to such disclosure.
The Company’s obligation for the payment of legal fees hereunder shall be limited to the
reasonable fees of [counsel firm] only.
(c) None of Buyer or its Representatives shall have any liability to the Company in
connection with the disclosure of the Disclosure Information as set forth in this Section.
(d) The Company shall, simultaneously with its filing of the Cleansing Document,
represent in writing to Buyer that all information that the Company deems to be Disclosure
Information has been publicly disclosed, and Buyer shall be entitled to rely upon such
representation in all respects. 

(e) Without limiting the parties’ rights under this Section, it is the parties’ current
expectation that, with respect to business plans, term sheets, proposals and similar documents
relating to a Transaction, only the most recent versions in any transactional construct (as such
most recent versions may be orally supplemented) exchanged by each party to any negotiations
would be included in the Disclosure Information.
(f) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyer’s sole and exclusive remedy for any
breach by the Company of any representation, warranty, or covenant in this Section, except with
respect to the Company’s obligation for the reasonable fees of counsel and other reasonable
expenses directly associated with disclosure as set forth in paragraph (b), is to disclose the
Disclosure Information as provided hereunder in accordance with the terms of paragraph (b), and
neither the Company nor any of its affiliates or Representatives shall have any liability at law or
in equity for any breach by the Company of its obligations pursuant to this Section.
