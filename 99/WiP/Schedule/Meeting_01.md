2. Manifesto

    Legal transparency, efficiency, quality

    Make legal docs available in "source" format, on GitHub, etc.
    
    Use the tools of coders. Pull-requests, etc.
    
    Express transactions and relationships in a "graph"(sic?). CodersNote = suggested edit to object-oriented law (graph may be confusing at this stage). 
    
    Connect to model document projects.
    
    Encourage "decentralized" data management.
    
    Make the case for governance of legal source code - a Digital Napoleonic Code.
