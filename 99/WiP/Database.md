Databases:

Files in Git - as at Github.com/CommonAccord/NW-NDA/

JSON, XML.

Graph databases, conventional databases.  IPFS and blockchains.


Really Technical:

Mirage, OCaml:  All data and code understood as git repos. https://github.com/mirage/irmin
Which leads back to the question, could a transaction system - for instance a financial system - be organized in a decentralized manner as git repos and pull-requests?  Might that address the problem that blockchains address, without many of the disadvantages?  Is there an intermediate layer that is needed (Corda or other)?
