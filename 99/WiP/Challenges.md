Would it be attractive to corporate counsel if we lawyers shared templates and collaborated like coders?  Can we demo that through NDAs?  To meet the challenge in steps:

1. Can lawyers use the same platform as coders to do and share legal work? 

2.  Getting on GitHub.  Doing a pull-request.  (First indication at SciencesPo is good.)

3.  Getting a local app (VS Code).  Making some changes, doing a pull-request.

4.  Using modularity.  A term sheet that references a form.  A form that references its sections.  A second draft that references the first draft.

5.  Structuring a (NDA) agreement - headings and parties, sections, defined terms, cross-references, annexes.

6.  Alternative use cases - making multiple NDAs from a single library.

7.  Ontologies - how do we refer to persons, places, things?

8.  Fit with automation - dual purpose parameters. 

9.  Fit with data security - scaling without loss of privacy or security.

10.  Fit with NLP/AI/ML - using patterns to guide the user (and using patterns in legacy documents).

11.  (Because things that go up to 11 are better.)

Something like that.
