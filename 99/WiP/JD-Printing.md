JD Printing:

This is a pun on 3D printing.  The notion is that a person can make legal things happen by printing something.  This cute phrase masks a common operation.  In many situations - notably in dealing with government - a legal objective can be achieved by printing, signing and submitting some documents.  If the documents are right, the government office accepts the documents, stamps and files or provides a reciept, and causes the result.  For instance, registering a vehicle, filing taxes, obtaining a permit or registering a complaint.

Increasingly, government operations are done online, so an equivalent is a sophisticated autocomplete system and receipt on the site or by email.

In either case, paper or digital media, the user's system could generate the documents or fill-ins and the user could then report whether they were successful, ideally by registaring the government's reply in the system.  If proposed documents or data failed, the system would have learned that there is a defect in its understanding, and could try again.  The try-again might be by analytics, by reaching out for a broader data set or by asking an expert.  An eventual correct result would represent learning for the user and potentially for the community of users. 

Note that this would allow automating a bureaucracy from the outside.  The logic of the bureaucracy would be modelled by the community of users' experience of acceptance or rejection.  It would generate the inputs and outputs without touching the governement's automation system or hierarchy.

We expect that there are situations where this kind of "permissionless" or crowd-sourced automation will move faster than an internal automation project.  Much will depend on there being a community with an interest and a relatively high volume of activity.
