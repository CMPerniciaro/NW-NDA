Usual blurb about problems of contracting.  


*Open-Sourced Legal Document Standardization*

Solution:

1. Use GitHub for collaboration on legal templates, involving communities of experts and continuous improvement.  (Git)

2. Use a document "source" format that allows efficient, transparent combinations of clauses into full documents. (Prose Objects)

3. Encourage communities to share standards, including through standards organizations such as IS0, ALI-ELI, WorldCC, and model document projects of every stripe.  (Communities)

4. Use standard coders' tools (Visual Studio Code) for heavy-duty collaboration.  (IDEs)

5. Have an open API to allow use in any contract management system.

6. Create a secretariat to provide technical support for the various communities. (Centre for Decentralised Law, OpenTrustFabric.org)
