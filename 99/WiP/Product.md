This node is a draft proposition to the "client."  The client is assumeed to be corporate counsel - the chief legal officer of a corporation.

Usual blurb about problems of contracting.  Repetitive negotiation, suboptimal terms, expense of keeping up-to-date, inconsistencies among outside counsel, lack of integration with other systems.


*Open-Sourced Legal Document Standardization*

Solution:

1. Use GitHub for collaboration on legal templates, involving communities of experts and continuous improvement.  (Ready-made platform.)

2. Use a document "source" format that allows efficient, transparent combinations of clauses into full documents. (Efficient reuse.)

3. Encourage communities to share standards, including through standards organizations such as IS0, ALI-ELI, WorldCC, and model document projects of every stripe.  (Go together, not alone.)

4. Use standard coders' tools (Visual Studio Code) for heavy-duty collaboration.  (Don't need to reinvent interfaces and methods.)

5. Have an open API to allow use in any contract management system.  (Interfade to existing systems.)

6. Create a secretariat to provide technical support for the various communities. (Help crossing the chasm.  Centre for Decentralised Law, OpenTrustFabric.org)
