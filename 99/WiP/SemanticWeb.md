Semantic Web:

There is a strong overlap between the Prose Object model and a semantic web. Prose Objects can be understood to be a primitive kind of semantic web that is expressed in a minimalist source format.  Semantic web tends to be oriented toward metadata embedded in rendered pages. The information presented in the page is wrapped in invisible metadata which allows a machine to understand what it means.

The orientation of Prose Objects is to focus on the objects that represent the knowledge and to wrap the key meta-data around the values as they are rendered into a page.

In the version from 2010, this enabled substantial navigation and presentation possibilities. This kind of rendering and presentation would be a major improvement over the current implementation. It would make a much stronger impression and a powerful tool for user-friendly editing of legal documents. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZfsyTPYFIA">Seed Investment and Stock Options - YouTube</a>

We can learn from semantic web.
