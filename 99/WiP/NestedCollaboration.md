Nested Collaboration:

An inter-business negotiation will often involve a tree of conversations:

The two parties will have a channel between them, often two or more channels, led by the lead lawyer for each side, by the lead business persons, by the lead technical persons.  

Each of the lead persons will often rely on others within their organization or in outside consultancies (e.g. law firms).  

There will be drafts and proposed modifications made within those internal groups which will be vetted, tweeked, discarded, saved, by the lead. 

And each of these pods of conversation may have sub-pods.  The law firm may have a team that works together and only the lead lawyer at the firm directly communicates new materials to the client.  Same within engineering, marketing, etc.

Git enables this kind of nested collaboration.  It will be important to do some examples and figure out good practices.
