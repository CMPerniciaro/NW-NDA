Non-Disclosure Agreements:

Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs, sometimes also called CDA for Confidential Disclosure Agreements) are a type of contract Agreement.  Their purpose is to permit one party to confide information to another, or for both parties to mutually confide to the other.  

NDAs are also often embedded in other contracts as sections on Confidentiality.  

NDAs also resemble agreements such as Data Sharing Agreements and Consents to use of confidential, private or medical informaiton.

Some NDAs in Prose Object format can be found in at /S/Index/NDA.md.

Are NDAs just a different name for "Consents to Use of Information" ? https://healthcaresecprivacy.blogspot.com/2020/12/actual-consent-is-more-important-than.html?m=1
