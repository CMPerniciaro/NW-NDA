Fractal:

A solution to transacting will have at least two "fractal" dimensions.  Fractal means that the a closer look at something looks a like a broader look.  That is, it's turtles all the way down.

The first and most important dimension in which a solution to transacting is fractal relates to participants.  An individual seeking to transact and manage their transacting needs a comprehensive picture of their transactions - those completed, current and prospective.  To have that, the individual's trading partners will need to use the same vocabulary and messaging (APIs).  For those trading partners to be able do that, they in turn will need a comprehensive view of their transactions and of their relations with their trading partners.

This gets more apparent as we shift to an enterprise view.  To have an adequate (comprehensive) view of its affairs, an enterprise needs for its various agents to work in a common vocabulary and messaging system, and they need to work with the enterprise's trading partners in a conforming model, and that out across the supply chains. 

This also happens at the full economy level.  A government regulator needs to work with its regulatees (sic) in a common vocabulary/API, and the regulatees can only be really compliant if their internal vocabularies conform to the reporting vocabulary, which ....    For instance a central bank - e.g. the European Central Bank - whose direct regulatees are banks, is essentially a portfolio of portfolios (banks) of portfolios (enterprises) of portfolios (customers, trading partners, other regulators) of contracts.


Sources (authorship of paradigms) is a second dimension in which the transacting infrastructure is fractal.  The end-user - a business person or individual doing a transaction - relies on experts immediately at hand - their lawyer, their friend, their boss, their community - to guide them. The experts rely on other experts, and so on down a chain.  An example of a chain would be an interface for a transacting that has a few options and some guiding data (e.g. an e-commerce website).  That was developed by reliance on a lawyer and a web-developer, both of whom used materials recommended by their peers or deeper experts.  They in turn relied on legal structures and software code that was developed by more expert communities, all the way down to an operating system or a constitution and legal tradition. 

This is obvious.  The important part of pointing this out is that each level involves making it easier for the next level to leverage the work.  So the solution isn't to make the solution so simple that the end-user fully understands - that would involve giving them a full education in software, law, data security and the direct subject matter (e.g. toaster ovens).  Or giving them a Swiss Army knife and best wishes.  The end solution can be superficially "simple" even as the machinery is complex.  

But this layering embeds a problem.  The layers of experts worked without knowledge of the user's actual needs, desires, problem.  Even when the user informs their immediate expert, that expert may not have the knowledge, authority or access to tweek the system to fit the user's situation.  A really good system would allow tweeking by the user/expert at each level.  This is the origin of Ward Cunningham's "wiki" notion (if the user thinks there should be content at a certain URL, let them make it!).  Also of the GNU initiative.

A really good solution must allow the user and intermediate user/expert to make changes that their expert/supplier did not anticipate.  This idea connects to Zittrain Generativity.  It could also connect to self-govenance, community-based governance, subsidiarity, federalism, deference.
