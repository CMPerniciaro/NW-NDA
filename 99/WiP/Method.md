Method:

On one hand, this whole project is about law borrowing a method from coding - modularity, versioning, running code - from coding.  The thesis is that if we (lawyers) adopt this method, we will become efficient, help markets clear, help make principles clear. 

But "method" can go further.  What are the methods of production, transacting, marketing, innovating, knowing.  For instance, in production there is the method of standardization - interchangeable parts.  In transacting the notion of fixed prices (department stores) and aggregated reputations (Airbnb, Uber, most of e-commerce). In  innovating the method of exploring upsides first, before downsides.

In "knowing" there are (at least) <i>a priori</i>, authority and scientific.  Where does law sit in this?  Law is largely self-referential - a thing is so because someone wrote that it is so or we have optimism that we can persuade someone that it is so.  A jury-based system adds an important, visible part of <i>a priori</i>.  Law has hierarchies of authority.  Perhaps there is an additional category of history - a track record of <i>a priori</i> and authority (Holmes's "experience"?). 

A "scientific" method in law is difficult, even dangerous in its invitation to excess.  But it is important and digitization (particularly around a graph of Prose Objects?!) makes it more available.  Information can be more easily obtained, results more easily understood.  Waze for Law, what pathways do transactions take, how do they work out and how can we optimize them?  This is the basis of the EU project - the EU Commission as regulator wants a deeper and finer-grained picture of the EU economy to enable better regulation.  That, of course, is also what enterprises want regarding their supply chains and contract relationships.  

The intellectual inspiration for that view is influenced by economics, but the root of is "Pragmatism" - an American philosophical tradition that applies a scientific method to thought, argumentation and action.  A method that is careful about ideas and can be understood to connect law, sociology and economics with the methods of chemistry and biology. Perhaps this all comes together in statistics and modeling.  

Legal "quality" seems a related question.
