Over-Fitting:

There is an AI notion of over-fitting.  If you can make an infinite number of cuts and seams, you can make a jacket that fits perfectly.  But did you understand the body, will the jacket still fit when the customer sits down?

This fits into a general tension in pattern-recognition between fitting a pattern and noticing principles.  Principles, a theory, is still important.  A classic example is that earth-bound pattern recognition would not have allowed generalization to a theory of movement of the planets, stars and beyond.  A theory of A = F/M or E=MC^2 can predict some things better than experience.

We are likely to find the same notion scattered about in law. Conforming to every circumstance may result in a washboard road rather than an efficient one, cowpaths. 

Consider whether the French principle that court judgments must always be a single (very long) sentence, in a particular structure, reasoning from the Code (statutes) not other court decisions and ending in a decisional verb.  Or the US common law judges' abandonment of the effort to define a standard for negligence more specific than "reasonable."  Or a lawyer's duty of confidentiality.  Going deep into details puts you deep in the weeds.

Consider as a counterbalance to Anthony J. Casey and Anthony Niblett's "Death of Rules and Standards" https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2693826
