Over-Fitting:

There is an AI notion of over-fitting.  If you can make an infinite number of cuts and seams, you can make a jacket that fits perfectly.  But did you understand the body, will the jacket still fit when the customer sits down?

This fits into a general tension in pattern-recognition between fitting a pattern and noticing principles.  Principles, a theory, is still important.  A classic example is that earth-bound pattern recognition would have allowed generalization to a theory of movement of the planets, stars and beyond.  A theory of A = F/M or E=MC^2 can predict some things better than experience.

We are likely to find the same notion in law. Conforming to every circumstance may result in a washboard road rather than a smooth road. Without being sure, consider whether the French principle that court judgments must always be a single (very long) sentence, in a particular structure, and must reason from the Code (statutes), not other court decisions.  Smoothing. 

Lots of materials on this subject.  For instance, this one on separating policy and mechanism, and relegating AI to mechanism.  : https://bford.info/post/2020-11-18-ai-governance/  (The author distinguishes this from "mere" Human|Society-In-The-Loop.  There must be an articulable principle, expressed by humans.)
