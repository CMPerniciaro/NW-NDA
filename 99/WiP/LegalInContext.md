Legal In Context

Placing “legal” in context:

1. Legal is a feature (quality), not a product.  The purpose is the transaction.  Most transactions can be completed without legal questions or intervention.  It is the most complex or original ones, or the edge cases that call for legal design, expertise or repair.

2.	Error handling on transactions

    21.	Happy path, unhappy path

    22.	What does business want from legal? (Or, what are currently the demands for "legal" intervention? What is the role of legal?)

3.	Governance, democracy and rule of law

    31.	Government as meta-contract manager.  A portfolio of portfolios.

    32. Legitimacy - in what language(s) do we decide the rules? - is this a question of jurisdiction or formality of language (the latter perhaps points to complexity) 

    33. Autonomy, Subsidiarity, Law of the Parties - Who decides? 
    
    34. What should legal prevent business from getting? (I would fit this with 22 because it seems to me two sides of the same coin) 

4. Documents as legal "reality", "incompleteness"

5. Algorithms as "lossy" (shedding context).
