Legal In Context

Placing “legal” in context:

1. Legal is a feature, not a product.  The purpose is the transaction.

2.	Error handling on transactions

    21.	Happy path, unhappy path

    22.	What does business want from legal?

3.	Governance, democracy and rule of law

    31.	Government as meta-contract manager.  A portfolio of portfolios.

    32. Legitimacy - in what language(s) do we decide the rules?

    33. Autonomy, Subsidiarity, Law of the Parties - Who decides?
    
    34. What should legal prevent business from getting?

4. Documents as legal "reality", "incompleteness", 

5. Algorithms as "lossy" (shedding context).
