Ti=US 

1.sec=The US has sub-jurisdictions with their own laws.  We use the postal abbreviations for the state names, and DC, PR etc. 

2.sec=There is a /00/ folder which has common elements for the US.  (This /00/ notion is good because it sorts on the top in file systems.) 

3.sec=The US has only one official language.  But in some jurisdictions other languages are also official, so we do encounter the language branching. 

4.sec=This priority of sub-jurisdiction over language is a design question that should be discussed.  It has no ultimate impact on the graph, because the graph is indifferent to the file tree structure (it merely treats the file paths as components of the node name string).  But it is useful for the collaboration in Git, since repos _are_ based on files and folders.
