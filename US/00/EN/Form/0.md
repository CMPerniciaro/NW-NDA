Ti=California Forms in English

1.sec=In the /Form/ folder, we have model NDAs.  

2.sec=Forms consist mostly of the frame of the agreements, outlines of the sections, and many references to the sections in the /Sec/ folder and in the /00/Form/ framing elements. 

3.sec=We expect that there will be many NDA types: e.g., Mutual, P1->P2, P1<-P2 ; technical information, business information, a specific trade secret, etc.  They will mostly build on one another, with each variation being a list of differences vis-a-vis a base Form.
