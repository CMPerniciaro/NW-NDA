Ti=Forms and Sections

0.sec=We make a basic division into:

1.Ti=Form

1.sec=Forms - document objects intended as whole forms - a Mutual NDA Agreement, for instance. 

2.Ti=Sec

2.sec=Sections of agreements.

3.Ti=Annex

3.sec=There is also potential need for other components - for instance Appendixes, Schedules, etc.  Could be grouped as "/Annex/".

00.sec=Note that we have not made a branch at the level of the type of agreement - e.g. NDA, Loan, Sale.  This whole repo is for NDA - and that is in its repo name.  It will ordinarily be mounted as NW-NDA - which tells the user that it is about NDAs.  The correct organization will vary based on the scope of the community.  An advantage of a graph is that these can be recombined.
